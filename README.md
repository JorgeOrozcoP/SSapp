High fidelity prototype for "Agricultura Digital"
###Repo Description
The code in this repo comprises the high fidelity prototype designed for the "Agricultura Digital" application. This prototype was subject to a usability test with real potential users from Matlahuatales de Aquiles Serd√°n, a community in Puebla, Mexico whose main econimic activity is agriculture.

###Project Definition and Justification
Several agricultural communities in different parts of Mexico have suffered the consequences of poor crop management. Families in those communities cannot easily agree on what type of crop to grow, resulting in seasons in which a single product may be grown by most of the town, or not growing another that could possibly satisfy the market's needs. This lack of organization mainly translates in unappropriate utilization of the land and poor competitivity. 

The project is intented to be tested in the town of Acatzingo, a community located in the mexican state of Puebla. 
Some of the main roadblocks that the proyect faces are that acatzingo is a community lacking proper resources both, financially and technologically, and the people are most likely to never have had contact with a computer. It is also likely that they cannot read or write.
